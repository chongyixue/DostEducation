# DostEducation
Insight Project

# Problem Statement
 Dost Education is a non-profit Education Tech company. Parents sign up either directly, or through partner origanisations, which then receives daily 1 or 2 minute phone calls for activity suggestions to do with their child to promote early developmental learning. Their transactional database is not optimal for analytical purpose and reporting. 

# Solution
A data warehouse will be built for the purpose of analytics and visualization through Chartio. Batch processing will be done on the google-managed PostgreSQL database.
